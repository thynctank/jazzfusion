  - Router
    - needs to handle retrieving controllers (if not already loaded), views
  - Config
     - but maybe also config for dir structure - custom viewParsers/Router especially)
  - Launch
     - need a JazzFusion.run() method - loads all controllers from list, runs View.hijack(), potentially loads a first controller/action
  - View
    - hijack links/forms (call upon Router for assigning behaviors)
    - Layouts, Views and Partials...
    - passing controller/action context to view code itself (not just parser): assign JazzFusion.currentController + JazzFusion.currentAction references 
  - Action
    - redirectTo (redirect to another action or controller/action)
    - filters and applying them to specific actions (set each Action object's filter functions from Controller constructor after each action instantiated)
    - render (render alternate actions, alternate controller + action), render JSON, call remote services
  - Generators
    - controllers + helpers, JazzRecord models + migrations
