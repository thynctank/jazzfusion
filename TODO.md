   - Action
      - render
      - redirectTo
   - View
      - passing controller/action context to view code itself (not just parser): assign JazzFusion.currentController reference
      - instructions for users on how to define new view parsers
   - Router
      - needs to handle retrieving controllers (if not already loaded), views
   - Config
      - figure exactly what needs to be listed (probably just a list of controllers, but maybe also config for dir structure - custom viewParsers especially)
   - Launch
      - need a JazzFusion.run() method - loads all controllers from list
